question: 'Sometimes you need a break from all the Christmas-themed treats
So grab yourself a dessert that really can’t be beat (and that Julia loves to eat)
You might know it by the pink box
Or the dozens of goodies they always have in stock
Either way, it’s time to make a stop
At the place with a namesake that could be your Pop'
answer: The Holiday
