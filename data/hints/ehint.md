question: 'Put on an apron, roll up your sleeves, and wear your closed toed shoes
At the place you seek youâ€™ll need all these and maybe a wheel or two

A place fragile like glass but built to last no other shop competes
You can take a class if you wear a mask and think you can handle the heat

When you arrive, all but one should hide though the rest should able to see
Keep open the eyes and peer inside something familiar sits in the tree'
answer: Elf
