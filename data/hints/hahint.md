question: 'As you walk along think of the Hozier and follow where it leads
You can’t quite take a bath but it’s not so bad it’s the symbol that you need
Named after a Bay Area city this place isn’t quite a gritty but it’s older than believed
Just stay outside, you’ll receive a sign. Is it in the words that you read?'
answer: Home Alone
